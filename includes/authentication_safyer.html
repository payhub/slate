<h2 id="how-we-use-oauth-2.0-to-assure-security">How we Use OAuth 2.0 to Assure Security</h2>

<p><strong><code class="prettyprint">Oauth 2.0</code></strong> is an industry-standard, and widely accepted, authentication and authorization mechanism for providing third party applications and clients secure access to a user&rsquo;s resources hosted service providers.</p>

<p>Typically, the third party (or client) is granted access to a user&rsquo;s resources hosted by a service provider, using a unique token generated by the service provider at the time the user authorizes the client access to their resources. Think of the situation where you authorize a web site to register you using your identity hosted on Facebook (you click the &lsquo;log in with Facebook&rsquo; button on the web site and authorize the site to access your information on Facebook)..    </p>

<p>The Safyer RESTful Web Services currently uses OAuth 2.0 with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You as the Client</p></li>
<li><p>And SignaPay as the Service Provider</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a new third party integrator, you will be assigned a unique token that you will use when requesting access to resources from the Service Provider.</p>

<p>Currently you can obtain this token by contacting your relationship manager.</p>

<aside class="notice">
Once you have your token, <strong>it is very important that you treat this as you would a user and password</strong>: never reveal it to anyone other than authorized developers, and never reference it in publicly available source code such as publicly exposed JavaScript or HTML pages.

<h2 id="using-your-oauth-2.0-token-in-calls-to-safyer-restful-web-services">Using Your OAuth 2.0 Token in calls to Safyer RESTful Web Services</h2>

<p>Once you have the token, you can use it to authenticate your application to the Safyer RESTful Web Service by using the OAuth 2.0 standard HTTP Authorization Header structured as in this example:</p>

<p><strong>Header Field Name</strong>: Authorization</p>

<p><strong>Header Value</strong>: Your-token-here</p>
