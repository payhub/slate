#AuthOnly Transaction
This topic provides the information about the **AuthOnly** transaction.

You can use the AuthOnly transaction to authorize an amount on your customer's credit card without making the actual settlement of that amount. With the AuthOnly transaction, you actually reserve an amount for a certain period against the credit limit of the card holder.

Usually, you use the AutOnly transaction type when you are selling an item, which is currently out of stock. So, you run the AuthOnly transaction when the item is not available and when the item becomes available in the stock, you run the Capture transaction to actually make the settlement for the reserved amount. To simply say, the AuthOnly and Capture transactions are essentially a sale process in two steps.

The sale is considered complete when you successfully complete both the Capture and AuthOnly transactions. The money will be debited from the card holderâ€™s account and credited to your account after the sale is complete.

When the AuthOnly transaction is successfully executed, you will receive a 201 Created code on a successful AuthOnly. This code also includes the transaction ID. You can use this transaction ID to run the Capture transaction.
